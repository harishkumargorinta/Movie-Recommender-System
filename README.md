# Movie Recommender System

This Python project implements a Movie Recommender System, which suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past viewing history.

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users. It analyzes user ratings and movie metadata to generate personalized recommendations.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web-based application, optional)
- SQLAlchemy (for database management, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Movie_Recommender_System.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Movie_Recommender_System
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure that you have a dataset containing user ratings and movie metadata.
   - The dataset should be in a format compatible with Pandas DataFrame.

2. Train the recommender system:
   - Run the training script to train the recommender system using your dataset.
   ```
   python train.py --dataset path_to_your_dataset.csv
   ```

3. Get movie recommendations:
   - Once the system is trained, you can use it to get movie recommendations for a specific user.
   ```
   python recommend.py --user_id user_id
   ```

4. Web-based application (optional):
   - If you want to deploy a web-based movie recommender system, you can use Flask to create a web interface.
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Database management (optional):
   - If you want to store user ratings and movie data in a database, you can use SQLAlchemy for database management.
